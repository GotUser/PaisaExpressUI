# react-text-mask-hoc Â· [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-text-mask-hoc.svg)](https://npm.im/react-text-mask-hoc)

> A higher-order [text-mask](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask)
component for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and
[React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

`text-mask` is great. It's a feature-rich solution for creating input
masks for various libraries and frameworks. However the React
implementation has some long-standing bugs and feature requests that
bury the potential of the library.

__Features:__

- Supports all features from `text-mask`, see its
[documentation](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/componentDocumentation.md)
for more information.
- __Custom components:__ you can mask any components through a simple
[adapter](#adapters) interface!
- __Platform agnostic:__ works in all browsers, React Native and Node.js
(useful for server-side rendering)!

## Install

```bash
yarn add react-text-mask-hoc
  # or
npm install --save react-text-mask-hoc
```

## Usage

```jsx
import {TextMask, InputAdapter} from 'react-text-mask-hoc';

export default () =>
    <TextMask
        // You can provide your own adapter component or use one of included in the library.
        Component={InputAdapter}
        mask={['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]}
        guide={false}
        value="5554953947"
    />;
```

To use in React Native import `react-text-mask-hoc/ReactNative` instead:

```jsx
import {TextMask, TextInputAdapter} from 'react-text-mask-hoc/ReactNative';
```

## API

### `TextMask`

A component that grants `text-mask` functionality to the passed component.

It's a controlled component by default, but it also maintains its own
state, however it can also be switched to uncontrolled.

__Props__

- all [`text-mask` settings](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/blob/master/componentDocumentation.md)
- `Component` _(React.Component)_: A component that follows the [adapter](#adapters)
specification.
- `[value]` _(String|Number)_: A value that will be masked. Will be used
as an initial value on mounting, and later can be used to control
the component. If `isControlled` prop is set to `false`, the value will
be ignored on rerenders. Defaults to `null`.
- `[isControlled]` _(Boolean)_: A way to set the component behaviour
to be controlled by a `value` prop or to ignore it (to be uncontrolled).
Can also be used to switch it in runtime. Defaults to `true`.
- `[onChange]` _(Function)_: A function that is called on input changes.
Takes 2 arguments: the native `event` (varies from a platform) and
the next state (has `value` and `caretPosition` properties).
- `[componentRef]` _(Function)_: A function that is called with a
reference to the `Component`.

__Instance methods__

- the `value` getter
- `focus()`
- `blur()`

### `withTextMask(AdaptedComponent)`

A helper [HOC](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/higher-order-components.html)
that passes `AdaptedComponent` down to the [`TextMask`](#textmask).

__Arguments__

1. `AdaptedComponent` _(React.Component)_: A component that
follows the [adapter](#adapters) specification.

__Returns__

An extended `TextMask`.

__Usage__

```jsx
import {withTextMask} from 'react-text-mask-hoc';

class MyAdapterComponent extends React.Component {
    // ...
}

const MyTextMaskComponent = withTextMask(MyAdapterComponent)

export default () =>
    <MyTextMaskComponent
        mask={['(', /[1-9]/, /\d/, /\d/, ')', ' ', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, '-', /\d/, /\d/, /\d/, /\d/]}
        guide={false}
        value="5554953947"
    />;
```

### Adapters

Adapters are React components that implement a special interface for the
[`withTextMask`](#withtextmaskadaptedcomponent).

List of adapters included in this library:

- for React
  - `InputAdapter`
  - `SpanAdapter`
- for React Native
  - `TextInputAdapter`
  - `TextAdapter`

__Specification__

An adapter must be a React component that takes `value`, `caretPosition`
and `onChange` props, and exposes a `caretPosition` getter that always
returns a positive integer number.

---

### `TextMaskTransformer`

A class that calculates a value and a caret position. Based on the
`createTextMaskInputElement()` from [`text-mask-core`](https://github.com/text-mask/text-mask/tree/master/core).

Exported for testing purposes only.
